      <h1>Accountable Protocol Customization</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Our mission is to <i>create a framework for protocol customization that
          reliably improves the security of networked computing environments.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Widely used network protocols evolve during their design phase and over
        their years of use. In addition, these protocols must work for a wide variety of
        devices and for a range of operating scenarios, including backward compatibility
        with previous versions. For these and other reasons, modern network protocol
        standards often contain a dizzying array of options with perplexing and
        unpredictable potential interactions. This complexity makes it immensely
        challenging to provide high assurance in the security of their designs and
        implementations. The central thesis of the proposed project is that accountable
        protocol customization offers a promising alternative to this status
        quo. Protocol customization involves identifying lean protocol subsets that are
        sufficient to meet the functional and security needs of relevant clients and
        servers (e.g. a Navy subnetwork that is outward facing) while preserving
        backward compatibility. Customization also supports protocol dialects that
        modify the original protocol standard in settings where backward compatibility
        is not a strict requirement (e.g., for an inward facing Navy
        subnetwork). Distinctively, the project will ensure that customization is
        “accountable”, i.e. we will carefully “account for” properties of customized
        protocols by tightly coupling protocol customization operations with rigorous
        analysis.  This coupling will be accomplished by creating and leveraging
        principled techniques for synthesis, testing, and verification of protocols. The
        project will create a scientific framework for accountable protocol
        customization that reliably improves security of contemporary and future
        networked computing environments. It will demonstrate the value of the framework
        by applying it to a diverse set of widely used and emerging real-world
        protocols, including the HTTPS/TLS ecosystem, network infrastructure, and
        standards for secure messaging, federated authentication, and the Internet of
        Things.
